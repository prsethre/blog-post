I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me or can you put Find us on Facebook by the Facebook logo?, make it pop. It's great, can you add a beard though we try your eye, but can you change everything? can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere, so the website doesn't have the theme i was going for start on it today and we will talk about what i want next time . Can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big I really think this could go viral, but the hair is just too polarising, yet can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front, yet I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer, I really think this could go viral. Thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix.",

Just let them happen. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Very easy to work these to death. Do an almighty painting with us. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.",
